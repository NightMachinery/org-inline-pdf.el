* org-inline-pdf

Org-inline-pdf enables inline PDF preview in Org buffers.

** Installation

This works only with Org 9.4 or later. You need to have [[https://cityinthesky.co.uk/opensource/pdf2svg/][pdf2svg]] installed in =exec-path=. You will be able to install it using a package management system, such as Homebrew or APT.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
# On macOS
brew install pdf2svg

# On Debian Linux
sudo apt install pdf2svg
#+END_SRC

You can install org-inline-pdf from MELPA. For manual installation, download =org-inline-pdf.el= into somewhere in your local directory and install it with =M-x package-install-file=.

Enable this feature in an Org buffer with =M-x org-inline-pdf-mode=. Add the following line to your init file to automatically enable the feature in newly opened Org buffers.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook #'org-inline-pdf-mode)
#+END_SRC

** Usage

You can just place links to PDF files using double brackets like =[[./figs/plot.pdf]]= in Org buffers. Linked PDF files will be displayed inline in the Org buffer by =org-display-inline-images= command.

*** Inline PDF in exported HTML file

This package also makes Org's HTML exporter ox-html to embed linked PDF files as images using =img= tag. Note that inline PDF using =img= tag is not standard and will be rendered only in particular browsers.  Safari.app is only the one I know.

** Known issues

Users of [[https://github.com/jkitchin/scimax][Scimax]] need to turn off a feature of scimax-org-images with =scimax-toggle-image-advice= for org-inine-pdf to work. See [[/../../issues/5][#5]].
